# weather_station
Academic project. Web service and client library that aim to manage data and obtain insights from weather stations. Both components were unit-tested.

NOTE: The imports were done to facilitate the software build with wheel, running a file might cause errors if those aren't changed.

To smoothly use the library's functionalities run `pip install SkyScribe-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl`. It is required to have access to a MongoDB database or container and run the SkyScribe/web_service/utils/get_data.py script beforehand.

The original data file was not uploaded due to the size limit.
